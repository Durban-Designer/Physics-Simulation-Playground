## The Final Frontier: Simulating Quantum Foam

The ultimate goal is to create a simulation that provides an intuitive glimpse into the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale.

*   **Objective:** To visualize the "quantum foam," the chaotic, fluctuating nature of spacetime at the smallest scales.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Discretized Spacetime:** Model spacetime as a 3D lattice.
    2.  **Quantum Fluctuations:** At each lattice point, simulate energy fluctuations based on the uncertainty principle. This can be modeled as a random process with a specific statistical distribution.
    3.  **GPU Acceleration:** Use a GPU-accelerated library like `cupy` or `numba` to perform the calculations on a large lattice in real-time.
    4.  **Visualization:** Represent the energy at each point in the lattice as a displacement or color in the 4th dimension. Render this as a dynamic, "foaming" 3D surface that is constantly changing.
*   **End Product:** A visually stunning animation of the quantum foam, providing a qualitative feel for the energetic nature of the vacuum.
