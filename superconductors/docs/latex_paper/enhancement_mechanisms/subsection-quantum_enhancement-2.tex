\subsection{Quantum Enhancement}
The idea that quantum effects like entanglement could enhance superconductivity is intriguing but, at present, highly speculative and lacks experimental validation. While our framework can be extended to include such physics, any implementation must adhere to strict scientific principles. If included, a model for quantum enhancement must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be based on a concrete theoretical mechanism for entanglement-enhanced pairing.
    \item Be validated against experimental verification in real materials.
    \item Account for the competition with decoherence effects, which typically destroy quantum coherence at the temperatures where superconductivity occurs.
    \item Include a realistic temperature dependence of any proposed quantum effect.
\end{itemize}
Until such evidence is available, this component of the model should be considered a research direction rather than a predictive tool.
