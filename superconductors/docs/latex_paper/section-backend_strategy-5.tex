\section{Computational Backend Strategy}
The predictive power of the proposed mathematical framework is realized through a sophisticated quad-brid computational architecture. This strategy leverages four distinct computational backends, each assigned to the tasks for which it is optimally suited. This ensures both performance and physical accuracy, from high-level orchestration down to the simulation of fundamental quantum phenomena. The following subsections detail the specific role of each backend: the classical CPU, the GPU, and the two powerful modes---analog and digital---of the Pasqal neutral-atom quantum computer.
