\subsection{GPU Backend}
The GPU backend serves as the classical high-performance computing workhorse. Its massively parallel architecture is essential for tackling the most numerically intensive parts of the theoretical model. Key tasks for the GPU include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solving the self-consistent BCS-Eliashberg integral equation, which can be discretized into large matrix operations well-suited for GPU acceleration.
    \item Running the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations required for Bayesian uncertainty quantification, where millions of model instances can be evaluated in parallel.
    \item Interfacing with and accelerating first-principles electronic structure packages (e.g., DFT) that have been ported to run on GPU hardware.
\end{itemize}
