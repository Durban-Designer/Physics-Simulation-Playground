\subsection{Analog Quantum Backend}
This backend leverages the analog mode of Pasqal's cloud-based neutral-atom quantum computer. In this mode, lasers are used to arrange real atoms into highly-programmable 2D or 3D lattice configurations that directly correspond to the crystal structure of a material of interest. This physical system is then allowed to evolve under a target Hamiltonian, effectively creating a quantum analog of the material itself. This approach is exceptionally powerful for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Directly observing the emergence of many-body phenomena, such as charge or spin density waves, by measuring the final state of the atomic lattice.
    \item Studying quantum phase transitions by smoothly varying the parameters of the Hamiltonian.
    \item Simulating the dynamics of quantum systems in a way that is intractable for classical computers.
\end{itemize}
A classical simulator is used during the development phase to validate the pulse sequences and atom arrangements before execution on the real quantum hardware.
