\subsection{Classical CPU Backend}
The classical CPU acts as the central orchestrator of the entire simulation workflow. It is responsible for the highest-level control logic, including data management, task scheduling, and communication between the other, more specialized backends. Furthermore, it directly handles any computational steps that are inherently serial or not sufficiently demanding to require acceleration, such as parsing inputs, final data aggregation, and executing the user-facing control software.
