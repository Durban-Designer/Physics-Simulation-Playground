\begin{abstract}
This paper lays the foundational mathematical and computational framework for a next-generation superconductor simulation platform. Moving beyond phenomenological models, we propose a rigorous, physics-based approach grounded in many-body theory. The framework integrates BCS-Eliashberg theory for the superconducting gap, Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory for disorder effects, and a mechanism for handling competing orders. We also detail models for realistic enhancement mechanisms and outline a robust computational architecture involving multi-scale physics and Bayesian uncertainty quantification. This document serves as the cornerstone for building a predictive tool capable of accelerating the discovery of novel superconducting materials.
