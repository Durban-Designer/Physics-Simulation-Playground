\subsection{Experimental Validation Framework}
The ultimate arbiter of the model's success is its ability to reproduce and predict experimental results. We will build an integrated validation framework that continuously compares model predictions against a large database of known superconductors.
\textbf{Required Datasets}: The database must be comprehensive, including cuprates (YBCO, BSCCO), iron-based superconductors (FeSe), organic superconductors, and heavy fermion systems.
\textbf{Validation Metrics}: The model's performance will be judged on a suite of statistical metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R-squared ($R^2$)}: Correlation between predictions and experiments. Target: $> 0.8$.
    \item \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)}: The average prediction error. Target: $< 10$K for $T_c$.
    \item \textbf{Bias}: Systematic over- or under-estimation. Target: $< 5$K.
\end{itemize}
Only a model that meets these stringent, pre-defined criteria can be considered scientifically credible.
