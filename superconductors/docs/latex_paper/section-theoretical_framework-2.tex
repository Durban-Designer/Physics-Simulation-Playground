\section{Core Theoretical Framework}
A predictive model for superconductivity must be built upon a solid foundation of many-body physics. We propose a framework that combines three essential theoretical pillars: BCS-Eliashberg theory to describe the pairing mechanism, a proper implementation of Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory to account for disorder, and a method to handle the crucial effects of competing electronic orders.
