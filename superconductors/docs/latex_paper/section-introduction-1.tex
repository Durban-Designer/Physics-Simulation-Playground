\section{Introduction}
The quest for room-temperature superconductors is one of the most significant challenges in modern physics. A computational platform capable of reliably predicting superconducting properties in novel materials would revolutionize this search. Current simulation efforts are often hampered by models that are too simplistic, failing to capture the complex, interacting physics that governs superconductivity. This paper presents a blueprint for a new model, moving away from such phenomenological approaches towards a rigorous framework grounded in the fundamental principles of many-body quantum mechanics. Our goal is to establish the mathematical and computational bedrock upon which a truly predictive simulation tool can be built. We will detail the core theoretical components, including the treatment of electron-phonon coupling, disorder, and competing electronic phases, and outline the computational strategy required to implement these theories effectively.
