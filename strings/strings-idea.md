# Physics Simulation Playground

An experimental computational physics project exploring string dynamics and quantum interactions using GPU acceleration.

## Overview

This is a learning-oriented project attempting to numerically simulate aspects of string theory that are typically only treated analytically. The goal is to understand the computational challenges involved and explore what's possible with modern hardware. This is purely exploratory - many approaches will likely fail or prove intractable.

## Current Focus

Starting with the basics and building up:
1. **Single String Dynamics** - Classical relativistic string simulation
2. **Quantum Corrections** - Attempting to add quantum effects to string motion
3. **String Interactions** - Exploring if we can simulate string splitting/joining

## Why This Project?

No one has successfully simulated full quantum string interactions from first principles. This is probably because:
- The math involves infinite-dimensional spaces
- Computational requirements are enormous
- Many technical obstacles exist

This project is an experiment to see how far we can push modern hardware (GPUs + quantum computers) toward this goal. Failure is expected and educational.

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Classical String (Currently Working On)
- Discretized string: ~100-1000 segments
- Nambu-Goto action: relativistic wave equation
- Visualize oscillation modes and energy distribution
- Validate against known analytic solutions

### Phase 2: Quantum Attempts (Experimental)
- Truncate to finite oscillator modes (N=5-20)
- Fock space representation of string states
- Try to compute quantum corrections
- Expect numerical instabilities and convergence issues

### Phase 3: Interaction Dreams (Highly Speculative)
- Light-cone string field theory formulation
- 3-string vertex (splitting/joining)
- Hybrid approach:
  - GPU: Monte Carlo sampling
  - Quantum computer: Small entanglement calculations
  - Classical: Orchestration and analysis
- Will likely need major approximations to be tractable

## Reality Check

What we're attempting has never been done because:
- String field theory has infinite degrees of freedom
- We're truncating to finite modes (massive approximation)
- Quantum corrections might blow up
- Convergence is not guaranteed

This is a learning exercise to understand:
- Why these calculations are so hard
- Where approximations break down
- What modern hardware can/can't do
- The gap between theory and computation

## Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 8.0+ (RTX 5090 recommended)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.0+
- C compiler with C11 support
- CMake 3.20+

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Usage (Planned)

### Phase 1: Classical String
```bash
# Single string evolution
./physics_sim --mode classical-string --segments 256 --time 1000

# Rotating string (should show Regge trajectory)
./physics_sim --mode rotating-string --angular-momentum 1.0

# Plucked string (watch mode decomposition)
./physics_sim --mode plucked-string --pluck-position 0.3
```

### Phase 2: Quantum Attempts
```bash
# IF we get this far...
./physics_sim --mode quantum-string --modes 10 --coupling 0.1
```

### Phase 3: Interactions (Speculative)
```bash
# Dream scenario - probably won't work
./physics_sim --mode string-interaction --strings 2 --max-modes 5
```

## Roadmap

### What We'll Try

- [ ] Classical string dynamics (should work)
- [ ] Mode decomposition and visualization (should work)
- [ ] Energy conservation checks (should work)
- [ ] Add quantum corrections (might fail)
- [ ] Truncated Fock space evolution (probably unstable)
- [ ] String interaction vertex (long shot)
- [ ] Hybrid GPU/quantum approach (very experimental)

### Expected Outcomes

**Likely to succeed:**
- Beautiful visualizations of string motion
- Understanding classical string physics
- Learning CUDA optimization for physics

**Might work:**
- Simple quantum corrections
- Low-mode truncations
- Perturbative comparisons

**Probably won't work:**
- Full quantum string interactions
- Non-perturbative effects
- Convergent results at strong coupling

But we'll learn why!

## Notes

This project is about learning through failure. String theory is notoriously difficult to compute numerically, and this project aims to understand exactly why. Every failed approach teaches us something about the gap between beautiful equations and practical computation.

If you're a string theorist: yes, I know this is probably impossible. That's the point.

If you're a programmer: welcome to the deep end of computational physics.
